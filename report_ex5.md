# Exercise 5: Working on the same repo - Soufiane AIT LHADJ

I was added in the repository: https://github.com/anirAchibane/soft_eng_tp5_exo5/
with: Anir ACHIBANE, Mouad Bensafir, Youssef Bentaleb 

I created a directory in my local machine, added a file called *soufiane.py*, and initialized a git repo in my local machine, created a new branch called *last_feature*, commited and then pushed to the remote repository:

```bash
C:\Users\dynabook\OneDrive\Bureau\CC_CI1\software_eng\git-lab-ex5>git init
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/dynabook/OneDrive/Bureau/CC_CI1/software_eng/git-lab-ex5/.git/

C:\Users\dynabook\OneDrive\Bureau\CC_CI1\software_eng\git-lab-ex5>git checkout -b last_feature
Switched to a new branch 'last_feature'

C:\Users\dynabook\OneDrive\Bureau\CC_CI1\software_eng\git-lab-ex5>git add soufiane.py
C:\Users\dynabook\OneDrive\Bureau\CC_CI1\software_eng\git-lab-ex5>git commit -m "last commit by soufiane, i guess"
